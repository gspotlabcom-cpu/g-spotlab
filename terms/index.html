1. Introduction

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the mobile game Merge Universe and any related websites, services, content, and features (collectively, the “Services”) provided by G-Spot Lab (“G-Spot Lab”, “we”, “us”, or “our”).

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Services, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use the Services.

These Terms work together with our Privacy Policy, which describes how we collect and process data in connection with the Services.

2. Eligibility

You may use the Services only if:

You are at least 13 years old; and

You are not prohibited from using the Services under applicable law.

If you are under the age of majority in your place of residence, you confirm that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf. Parents and guardians are responsible for supervising the use of the Services by minors.

Our game is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13.

3. License and Access to the Services

Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, G-Spot Lab grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to:

download and install one copy of the game on a device that you own or control; and

access and use the game solely for your personal, non-commercial, entertainment purposes.

You do not acquire any ownership rights in the game or any related content. All rights not expressly granted to you under these Terms are reserved by G-Spot Lab and its licensors.

We may modify, update, suspend, or discontinue any part of the Services at any time, with or without notice, and without liability to you.

4. Virtual Items, In-Game Currency, and Purchases

The Services may offer:

in-game virtual currency (for example, coins, gems, or similar);

in-game virtual items or boosters; and

other paid content or features (collectively, “Virtual Items”).

Virtual Items may be obtained:

by playing the game; or

by purchasing them through the app store platform (e.g., Google Play).

You acknowledge and agree that:

Virtual Items have no real-world monetary value and cannot be redeemed for real money, goods, or services outside of the game.

Your license to use Virtual Items is limited, personal, non-transferable, revocable, and solely for entertainment within the game.

You do not own Virtual Items; they are part of the Services and remain the property of G-Spot Lab.

All purchases of Virtual Items are made through the respective platform (such as Google Play), and are subject to that platform’s terms and payment rules.

Unless required by applicable law or the platform’s own refund policies, all purchases are final and non-refundable.

We reserve the right to change the availability, pricing, and functionality of Virtual Items at any time, including modifying or discontinuing Virtual Items, adjusting balance, or resetting progress (for example, in case of bugs, exploits, or abuse).

5. Advertisements

The game may display third-party advertisements (including rewarded ads) via services such as Google AdMob.

We do not control the content of third-party advertisements. Any interactions between you and an advertiser are solely between you and that advertiser. We are not responsible for any loss or damage arising from such interactions.

Where required by law, the game may ask for your consent for personalized advertising. You can change advertising preferences in your device or platform settings.

6. Google Play Games and Other Third-Party Services

The Services may integrate with Google Play Games or other third-party platforms to provide features such as:

achievements;

leaderboards;

cloud save;

account linking.

Use of these features is optional. If you choose to sign in or connect to such services, you agree to comply with the applicable third-party terms and policies (for example, Google Play Terms of Service and Privacy Policy).

We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or security of third-party services, and we are not liable for any damage arising from your use of them.

7. User Conduct and Prohibited Activities

You agree to use the Services only in a lawful manner and in accordance with these Terms.
You must not:

Use cheats, automation software, bots, hacks, mods, or any other unauthorized third-party tools to modify or interfere with the Services.

Exploit bugs, design flaws, or errors in the game to gain unfair advantage.

Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise derive the source code of the game, except where allowed by mandatory law.

Circumvent, disable, or interfere with any security or technical features of the Services.

Use the Services for any commercial purpose without our prior written consent.

Use the Services to harass, abuse, or harm other users or any third party.

Impersonate any person or entity, or falsely claim an affiliation with any person or entity.

Use the Services in violation of any applicable law or regulation.

We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor the use of the Services and to investigate and act against any violations of these Terms, including terminating or restricting access to the game.

If the game allows you to create or share content (for example, usernames or other input), you grant G-Spot Lab a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, display, and modify such content solely for the purpose of providing and improving the Services.

9. Updates and Changes to the Services

We may provide patches, updates, or other modifications to the game from time to time (collectively, “Updates”).
Updates may:

automatically install; or

require manual installation.

Certain features of the game may not operate properly if you do not install Updates. You agree that we may update the game and these Terms at any time, and that your continued use of the Services after any Update or change to the Terms constitutes your acceptance of the updated version.

10. Termination

You may stop using the Services at any time by uninstalling the game and ceasing all access.

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, including if:

you violate these Terms;

we discontinue or significantly change the game;

we are required to do so by law or by platform providers.

Upon termination, your license to use the game will automatically end. Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including, without limitation, intellectual property provisions, disclaimers, limitations of liability, and governing law) shall remain in effect.

We are not liable for any loss of progress, Virtual Items, or other data resulting from termination or uninstallation of the game.

11. Disclaimers

The Services are provided “as is” and “as available”, without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied.

warranties of merchantability;

fitness for a particular purpose;

non-infringement;

loss of data, game progress, Virtual Items, revenue, or profit;

damage to device, hardware, or software;

arising out of or in connection with your use of (or inability to use) the Services, whether based on contract, tort, or any other legal theory, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of certain damages; in such cases, the above limitations shall apply only to the extent permitted by law.

13. Indemnification

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless G-Spot Lab, its affiliates, licensors, and partners from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to:

You agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the competent courts located in the Republic of Kazakhstan, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.

Nothing in this section limits any mandatory consumer protection rights that you may have under the laws of your country of residence.
