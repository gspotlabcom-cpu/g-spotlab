    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of the mobile game
      <strong>Merge Universe</strong> and any related websites, services, content, and
      features (collectively, the “Services”) provided by G-Spot Lab (“G-Spot Lab”,
      “we”, “us”, or “our”).
    </p>
    <p>
      By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Services, you confirm that you
      have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to
      these Terms, you must not use the Services. These Terms work together with our
      <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You may use the Services only if you are at least 13 years old and are not prohibited
      from using the Services under applicable law. If you are under the age of majority in
      your place of residence, you confirm that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and
      agreed to these Terms on your behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our game is not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect data from them.
    </p>

    <h2>3. License and Access</h2>
    <p>
      Subject to your compliance with these Terms, G-Spot Lab grants you a limited,
      non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to download,
      install, and use the game on a device that you own or control, solely for your personal,
      non-commercial, entertainment use. All rights not expressly granted are reserved.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Virtual Items and Purchases</h2>
    <p>
      The Services may offer in-game virtual currency, virtual items, and other paid features
      (“Virtual Items”). You may obtain Virtual Items by playing the game or by purchasing
      them through the platform (such as Google Play).
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge that Virtual Items:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>have no real-world monetary value;</li>
      <li>are licensed, not sold, and remain the property of G-Spot Lab;</li>
      <li>may only be used within the game for entertainment purposes;</li>
      <li>are generally non-refundable, unless required by applicable law or by the platform’s own refund policy.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We may change, limit, or remove Virtual Items at any time, including adjusting game balance
      or resetting progress in case of bugs, exploits, or abuse.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      The game may display third-party advertisements, including rewarded ads, through
      services such as Google AdMob. We are not responsible for the content of third-party
      ads or for any interactions between you and advertisers. Where required by law, the
      game may ask for your consent for personalized advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services and Google Play Games</h2>
    <p>
      The Services may integrate with Google Play Games or other third-party platforms to
      provide achievements, leaderboards, cloud save, or similar features. Use of these
      features is optional and subject to the terms and privacy policies of the respective
      third-party providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not responsible for the availability, accuracy, or security of third-party
      services, and we are not liable for any damage arising from your use of them.
    </p>

      <li>reverse engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to access the source code of the game, except where allowed by law;</li>
      <li>circumvent or interfere with security or technical measures;</li>
      <li>use the Services for any commercial purpose without our written consent;</li>
      <li>harass, abuse, or harm other users or third parties (if communication features exist);</li>
      <li>violate any applicable law or regulation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>

      these Terms, you have no rights to reproduce, distribute, publicly display, or create
      derivative works from any part of the Services without our prior written consent.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Updates and Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may update the game and these Terms from time to time. Updates may be required for the
      game to function properly. Your continued use of the Services after an update or after
      changes to these Terms have been posted means that you accept the updated version.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      You may stop using the Services at any time by uninstalling the game. We may suspend or
      terminate your access to the Services at any time, including if you violate these Terms or
      if we discontinue the game. Upon termination, your license to use the game will end and
      you may lose access to game progress and Virtual Items.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      The Services are provided “as is” and “as available”, without warranties of any kind,
      whether express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by law, G-Spot Lab disclaims
      all warranties, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,

    </p>

    <h2>12. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      To the maximum extent permitted by law, G-Spot Lab and its affiliates and licensors shall
      not be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages,
      or for any loss of data, game progress, Virtual Items, revenue, or profits, arising out of
      or in connection with your use of the Services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where our liability cannot be excluded, our total aggregate liability to you will be limited
      to the amount you have actually paid (if any) for Virtual Items or other paid features in the
      six (6) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless G-Spot Lab

      Unless otherwise required by applicable law, these Terms and your use of the Services are
      governed by the laws of the Republic of Kazakhstan, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.
